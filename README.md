## Upgraded From Previous Project 
  This project is an **upgraded version** of my earlier basic Task Manager: 
- Original code (baseline): stores tasks as dictionaries, supports add/view/complete/delete/search, and saves to a single tasks.json.
- Current version (upgraded): improves structure, features, and UX while keeping JSON storage.
